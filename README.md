# Maqadeer App
The project of Advanced Programming Course.

## Project Idea:
If you are one of those who are perplexed and overwhelmed by the constant question “What am I going to cook today?” then this app is for you.
It keeps all your foodstuffs to give you a suggested meal to cook. It will keep all your needs in a menu list either manually or by relying on food staff that has been finished recently. Finally, it`s a good place to keep all recipes from social media that you plan to cook. In simple words, this app is your right hand in cooking.
