# Maqadeer_Application
The project of Advanced Programming Course.

# Project Idea:
If you are one of those who are perplexed and overwhelmed by
the constant question “What am I going to cook today?” then
this app is for you.
It keeps all your foodstuffs to give you a suggested meal to
cook. Also, it will keep all your needs in a menu list either
manually or by relying on food staff that has been finished
recently. Finally, it`s a good place to keep all recipes from
social media that you plan to cook. in simple words, this app is
your right hand in cooking.
